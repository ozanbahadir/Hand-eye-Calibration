This script implements the Continual Learning-based HEC approach using the Naive method or the reservoir buffer with class balance methods. Setting **buf=True** activates the reservoir buffer with class balance approach; otherwise, it defaults to the Naive CL method. The **robotname='CL'** parameter is pivotal as it partitions the dataset into subsets following the principles of CL methods.

This description clarifies how the script operates and the significance of its parameters in controlling the methodology applied to the dataset.
