## Description
This repository contains a Python script for simulating a UR5 robot with a Robotiq 140 gripper in a PyBullet environment. The script randomly generates positions and orientations for the robot's end-effector, captures RGB and RGBD images, and saves these images along with relevant data to files.
## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyBullet
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pickle
- Pillow


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ozanbahadir/Hand-eye-Calibration.git
```
2. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install pybullet numpy matplotlib pillow

```

## Usage
### Ensure you have the required URDF files for the UR5 robot and Robotiq 140 gripper. Place these files in the appropriate directories as specified in the script.

### Run the script:
